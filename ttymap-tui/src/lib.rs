//! ttymap — terminal map viewer.
//!
//! Renders Mapbox Vector Tiles as Unicode Braille characters in the terminal.
//! Inspired by [mapscii](https://github.com/rastapasta/mapscii).

// The crate is primarily a binary (see src/main.rs). The library exists so
// tests can share a module tree; external consumers only need the handful
// of items used by main.rs, so everything else is `pub(crate)`.

// Module organization is **flat by feature**, Neovim-inspired
// (cf. `src/nvim/`). The single concession to layering is `app/ui.rs`
// — the only place ratatui's `terminal.draw(...)` is called — which
// stays inside `app/` rather than getting its own `tui/` subdir.
// Everything else (compositor / map / input / palette / theme / lua)
// is a peer subsystem, named for what it does rather than for which
// layer it's "supposed" to belong to. We tried a strict `core/front`
// split (issue #212 Phase 4) and found it forced too many exceptional
// cases — sidebar policy is "UI" but lived in core because dispatcher
// owns it, theme_id leaked into core because every command tracked it,
// etc. Flat sidesteps all that.

/// Crate-wide command vocabulary — the GoF Command pattern's
/// **Command** role. The single enum every emission site (palette,
/// plugins, mouse, future RPC) speaks and that [`app::App::dispatch`]
/// interprets as the GoF Receiver. Sits at the crate root so every
/// emission site reaches it via `crate::UserCommand`.

/// Application — central state hub + event loop driver. Holds every
/// piece of mutable app-level state (map handle, lua handle,
/// compositor, theme, sidebar, …), drains the unified
/// [`app::AppEvent`] bus each iteration, and is the only place
/// `terminal.draw(...)` is called.
pub mod app;

/// `EngineHandle` — TUI-side handle to the `ttymap engine-worker`
/// subprocess. Wraps the parent end of the bincode-framed IPC stream
/// and presents the same surface as the in-process `MapHandle` so
/// [`app::App`] stays oblivious to the subprocess split.
pub mod engine_handle;

/// Compositor — stack-based focus / modal system (helix-inspired).
/// Owns the `Vec<(CardId, Box<dyn Component>)>` stack, routes key
/// events to the focused component, and exposes the `Component` /
/// `Window` framework that plugin-side wrappers (`LuaCardComponent`)
/// implement.
pub mod compositor;

/// Palette — `:`-triggered universal picker. Itself a [`Component`]
/// pushed onto the compositor stack; provider sub-modes (theme
/// picker, search, plugin commands) swap in place via
/// `PaletteAction::SwitchProvider`.
pub mod palette;

/// CLI subcommand implementations. Each subcommand lives in its own
/// submodule; `main.rs` parses the top-level enum and calls
/// [`cli::Command::run`].

/// Settings populated from `~/.config/ttymap/init.lua` + CLI overrides.
/// Wraps [`ttymap_engine::Config`] with binary-only knobs (runtime,
/// plugin disable list).

/// Terminal graphics helpers — render-mode selection, sixel
/// serialisation, and post-draw sixel painting.

/// Theme — binary-side ratatui adapter (`UiTheme`) and semantic-tag
/// resolver (`StyleKind`). The colour data (`ColorPalette`,
/// `ThemeId`, `DARK`/`BRIGHT`) lives in [`ttymap_engine::theme`] and
/// is re-exported from this module for ergonomic `crate::theme::*`
/// imports.

pub mod theme;

/// Input subsystem — raw-terminal-event ingest and translation
/// (input thread, keymap table, mouse adapter). [`app::App`] pulls
/// translated [`UserCommand`]s out of it for each `AppEvent::Input`.

/// File-based logging to XDG state directory.

/// Pub/sub event subsystem — Lua-agnostic primitive at the
/// integration point between Rust core and Lua plugin runtime.
/// Producers (Rust dispatcher, Lua bridge) call
/// [`event::EventBus::publish`]; subscribers (Rust closures, Lua
/// callbacks) react. Cross-thread publishes ride the App-level mpsc
/// via [`app::AppEvent::Bus`](app::AppEvent::Bus).
pub mod event;

/// Lua runtime for scripted plugins (mlua, Lua 5.4 vendored). The
/// bridge lives here: api/ exposes the `ttymap` global to scripts,
/// bridge/ adapts Lua specs to Rust traits (`Component`,
